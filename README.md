# 5G and IoT Integration: Optimizing Connectivity for Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC)

This project explores the integration of **5G networks with Internet of Things (IoT)** systems to enable optimized and scalable **massive machine-type communication (mMTC)**. It leverages an **ensemble of LSTM models and XGBoost** for predictive analysis of network demands, enabling dynamic resource allocation using **network slicing**.

## üìå Problem Statement

With billions of IoT devices expected to be connected via 5G, ensuring **low latency, scalability, and real-time communication** is a major challenge. Traditional resource allocation techniques are insufficient for managing such complex and dynamic requirements. This project addresses this by using machine learning techniques to forecast resource demands and optimize slicing in 5G networks.

- Predict the resource demands (bandwidth and latency) of IoT applications using an LSTM ensemble.
- Dynamically allocate resources via network slicing (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC).
- Improve prediction accuracy and efficiency over traditional methods.
